People find it difficult to search for this kind of software to play with, so the definition is relaxed for choosing available consoles. However, it's fairly simple to tell if one is **not** a fantasy console/computer:

1. Hardware such as RaspberryPi and Gamebuino are not
2. Emulators of real hardware (eg. NES, C64, DOSBox) are not
3. Generic graphics libraries and game engines are not
4. Programming IDEs and editors are not
5. Minecraft is not
